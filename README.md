# Data Structures and Algorithms in Python

<h2>Search Algorithms</h2>
<br>
<b>Linear Search:</b>
<br>
Time complexity - O(n)
<br>
<p>The linear search algorithm is used to find the index location
of a key by visiting each item in a collection until the key 
is found or the end of the collection is reached.</p>
<br>
<b>Binary Search:</b>
<br>
Time complexity - O(log(n))
<br>
<p>The binary search algorithm is used to find the index location
of a key using a binary strategy. The middle element of a sorted
collection is compared against the key, either returning the index
location if matched or repeating the process using higher or lower
information to eliminate half of the remaining collection. This
strategy is repeated until the key is found or the end of the
collection is reached.</p>
<br>
<h2>Sorting Algorithms</h2>
<br>
<b>Selection Sort</b>
<br>
Time complexity - O(n^2)
<br>
<p>The selection sort algorithm uses nested for loops to 
sequentially iterate through an unordered collection. Each inner
pass is used to find the index of the smallest item. 
At the conclusion of each inner pass the smallest item is swapped
in to the index of the outer loop.</p>
